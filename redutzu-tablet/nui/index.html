                        <p>Going forward /report without a reason will be ignored. A bad Example would be ‚ÄúI died because I was AFK‚Äù A good example of /report use is ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Magician‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSomeone is Breaking a BIG RULE.‚Äù Do not use this option for MINOR issues, Failure to follow this will result in warnings, kicks and following up, bans. </p>

                        <p><b>Suicide RP and Terrorism RP are not allowed.</b></p>
                        <p>We understand that this happens IRL, but they are touchy subjects that people do not need to be reminded of. There are minimal exceptions, please contact an admin for permission before roleplaying major suicide or terroristic acts.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>No RDM/VDM.</b></p>
                        <p>RDM (Random death match): killing/attempting to kill without intent and roleplay. VDM (Vehicle deathmatch): using a vehicle to kill/attempt to kill without intent or roleplay. KEEP IN MIND THAT WE ARE A ROLEPLAY SERVER. Deadly action needs to be roleplayed. Killing on site is not allowed as it could be seen as a form of RDM. Conflicts must be initiated verbally, tweeting, or texting.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Meta-gaming is not allowed.</b></p>
                        <p>Meta-gaming: the act of using out-of-character/external information for in-game situations. This includes stream sniping, 3rd party VOIP applications. Ex. Using something you heard, saw or read from another source to benefit or use as intel in game is not allowed and is considered Meta-gaming. Use of Discord Voice Chat is strictly prohibited even upon death.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Power-gaming is not allowed.</b></p>
                        <p>Power-gaming is the use mechanics or roleplaying mechanics that do not exist. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>No exploiting or hacking.</b></p>
                        <p>This includes: AFK farming, abusing in-game bugs, etc. This will result in an immediate ban.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Do not go AFK for long periods of time.</b></p>
                        <p>You will be kicked.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Follow the NLR rule.</b></p>
                        <p>NLR (New-Life Rule): if your character is hurt in a way in which they cannot survive (headshotted, burned to death, etc), as soon as you respawn/morgued, you will have no memory of how you died or who killed you. If you are revived by EMS, there is no NLR rule, however you must RP your injuries. Bleeding = Remember. Dead = No Memory. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Follow FearRP.</b></p>
                        <p>FearRP is fearing for your life. For example, if you are alone in an alleyway and 4 gang members hold you at gunpoint and you cannot escape without dying, you must follow FearRP. The average person would follow their demands as they are helpless in a situation of such, you wouldn‚Äôt just walk away. Even if you have a weapon on you, when someone pulls it out first you must comply. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Do not FailRP.</b></p>
                        <p>Due to the mechanics of GTA V, things that are completely unrealistic and down right impossible to do are easily done while in game. Think before you do, your actions should be thought out before you act. Realistic actions and responses. Everything you do must have a reason, RP reasons. Think ‚Äúwould I do this in real life?‚Äù and If the answer is No. Don‚Äôt do it. Additionally, there‚Äôs an unspoken rule regarding recognizing someone by their voice, this is strictly prohibited. Keep in mind you can be recognized by physical appearances.     </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Value your Life.</b></p>
                        <p>You must value your life and the lives of others. (Not at the detriment of your own.) For Example, do not draw a weapon while being held at gunpoint or carelessly injure NPCs. If you have a gun out and someone attempts to hold you up from the FRONT, you don‚Äôt have to surrender. If someone has a gun to your blindspot (behind) it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a weapon out, you must surrender from a realistic distance. If you have a gun to your head and you run away, this is FAILRP & Not valuing your life, it is strongly prohibited and at this point calling for RDM vocally will be considered a violation of several rules. Use /report. You must comply with reasonable demands if your life is under threat by weapons or being outnumbered.  You may not run at someone with a melee weapon if you‚Äôre held at gunpoint. You may drive away if someone points a gun at you and you‚Äôre already in your vehicle. Do not waterlog your vehicle off a bridge or beach. Cops obviously are not completely exempt from this rule, however due to the nature of their job they may approach dangerous situations while adhering to their SOPs. Use common sense.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Value of Freedom.</b></p>
                        <p>Once physically attacked you have the right to defend yourself or run to safety. Furthermore, the value of freedom should be considered when fleeing from robberies, however there is a reasonable point where the value of life trumps the value of freedom. For Example, if you‚Äôre surrounded by multiple officers with their guns out, fleeing in this case would be a violation of FailRP & Value of Life rules. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Incapcitated Law.</b></p>
                        <p>If you are incapacitated you MUST NOT know the names of anyone involved in your incapacition in the situations directly preceding that. This rule is including up to the point you were lured, captured or brought to the point of your incapacitation. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Combat logging will result in an immediate ban.</b></p>
                        <p>For example, logging out to avoid jail consequences or respawning without permission while in an RP situation can result in a ban. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Perma-death is upon your request.</b></p>
                        <p>You control the death of your character. If you choose to kill off your character, you cannot make a revenge character, this rule is set to prevent metagaming. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Do not speak ooc (out-of-character)</b></p>
                        <p>Unless being spoken to by Staff. There is no reason you should break character unless you are speaking to a staff member about a problem that needs to be resolved.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Vigilante RP is not allowed. </b></p>
                        <p>You are not Spider-Man, John Wick, Jason Bourne, or Daredevil.</p>

                        <h1><b>üëπ Criminal Rules:</b></h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>Committing criminal acts, violent or non-violent, in highly visible public areas, government buildings or job locations is forbidden. Highly visible means any crime that is not discrete or realistically able to be kept out of view for most people in an area. However, if the RP is started from outside of the aforementioned areas and leads inside of them, as long as the RP is reasonable and makes sense it may be continued into the zones. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>IMPORTANT TO NOTE: When robbing a bank no more than 4 people and no less than 2 can participate and you MUST have a hostage that is not someone you‚Äôre friends with. You may have 2 people outside of the building to make up your 4 total for robberies. Additionally, 30 Minutes before and 30 minutes after the tsunami has taken place there shouldn‚Äôt be ANY Illegal activities due to the fact it‚Äôs unrealistic and goes against the ‚ÄúFear for your Life‚Äù Rule we have in place.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>üôà Kidnapping & Mugging</b></p>
                        <p>Once per full day of Roleplay (IE: 24 Hours) you may successfully take someone against their will for monetary gains. This may not be abused and the situation behind the kidnapping must be played out to the best of the takers ability. Repeatedly taking the same person is abuse of this rule. Jacking someone for $2,000 and then killing them if they cannot produce a mere $2,000 would be an example of a scenario you will want to avoid.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>üôâ Police Pursuits</b></p>
                        <p>When it comes to an active pursuit, You may use your creative methods to get away. However, try to make your driving as true to real driving as can be. If you go off-roading on a sports bike just know the cops will do the same.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>üôä Red lights & Traffic</b></p>
                        <p>Traffic signals should be followed to the best of your ability. However, this does not mean you must stop at every red light and wait it out. Be warned though, you do face the risk of being ticketed or worse if caught by an officer. This being said, intentionally running lights and baiting a chase is not allowed. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>üö® Targeting of Emergency Services</b></p>
                        <p>Directly targeting Emergency Services with little to no reason (IE: Getting a ticket, Kidnapping EMS for little to no RP reason, etc‚Ä¶) should be avoided. Having a reason to try to avoid arrest (IE: A warrant, contraband etc‚Ä¶) could be a valid reason to resist arrest for example. This is not a cops and robbers server. The Emergency Services that provide RP and other scenarios for you shouldn‚Äôt be your main target for everything RP. Unjustifiable actions committed against Emergency Services will not be tolerated and can result in a ban. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>ü§ï Torture RP</b></p>
                        <p>Torture RP, while allowed, must be done within reason and the victim must be allowed to continue RP after the scenario with all body parts still functional and intact if they so choose to. They can keep any deformities left from the RP if they wish. Keep in mind, Torture RP exceeding 20 Minutes is strictly prohibited and will result in the situation being a FAILRP. Now would be the time to use /report as the situation now borderlines bullying. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>üíé Jewelry Store Robbery & Banks</b></p>
                        <p>Smash and Grabs are not allowed. If you start a robbery you MUST complete it. If you do not have a hostage, prepare to be breached by police since there‚Äôs no one in immediate danger. Demands may not be made without a hostage. One hostage equals one demand, Two hostages are equal to two demands. The demand cap is two demands no matter how many people you have as hostages. Carrying a hostage is strictly prohibited however you‚Äôre encouraged to use your trunk space.</p>

                        <p><b>BREAKDOWN NOTE:</b> Head, eyes, vocal chords, etc.: Lifestyle Citizens use slang to refer to real life components, in character.

However, they will call in crimes (notify police players) if they witness guns or violence in public areas, and often are used as a way to grab a car for transportation for criminal players (by killing or 'holding up' the NPC that was driving a vehicle).</p>
